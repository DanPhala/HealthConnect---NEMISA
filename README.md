## TECHNOLOGIES USED
- ### Main Application:
    - This is the Application in this Repository
    - **Backend:**
        - Django Web Framework: We chose this for additional backend capabilities and enhanced functionality using the MVC model.
        - FastAPI Integration: Utilizes FastAPI for a singleton connection to the database and all necessary queries as well as Auth.
        - NewsAPI Integration: Utilizes NewsAPI to enrich content and provide up-to-date information.
    - **Frontend:**
        - Python Jinja2 Syntax: Employs Python Jinja2 syntax for dynamic content rendering on the frontend.
        - Bootstrap: Uses Bootstrap, a front-end framework, to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.
- ### Application Interfaces
    - ##### HealthConnect FastAPI:
        - **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
        - **Unit Testing:** Demonstrates the importance of testing through unit tests for different components of the API.
        - **CI/CD (Docker, Heroku):** Implements continuous integration and deployment using Docker for containerization and Heroku for cloud hosting.
        - **Database Migration Tools (Alembic):** Incorporates Alembic for managing database schema migrations.
        - **Authentication (JWT Tokens):** Implements token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
        - **Virtual Environment:** Utilizes virtual environments for dependency isolation and management.
        - **Relational Databases (Postgres):** Integrates with Postgres as a relational database to store and manage data.
        - **Uvicorn ASGI Web Server:** Uses Uvicorn as the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) web server for FastAPI.
        - **GitHub Jobs:** Example routes that demonstrate fetching data from the GitHub Jobs API.
        - **SQLAlchemy:** An SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, used for database interaction.

- #### Dataset Used:

> https://www.kaggle.com/neelima98/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning

- ####  Data collection 

Data collection has been done from the internet to identify the disease here the real symptoms of the disease are collected i.e. no dummy values are entered. The symptoms of the disease are health related websites. This csv file contain 5000 rows of record of the patients with their symptoms(132 types of different symptoms) and their corresponding disease(40 class of general disease).

### REQUIREMENTS: Quick Setup/Guidelines for Running the Python API

- ###### Creating the Python Virtual Environment:
    ```markdown
    - sudo apt-get update
    - sudo apt-get install python3-venv
    - python3 -m venv <env_name>

    - pip install virtualenv
    - virtualenv -p python3 <env_name>

    # activating and deactivating virtualenv
    - source <env_name>/bin/activate
    - deactivate
    ```

- ###### Activating the Python Virtual Environment:
    ```markdown
    - source <env_name>/bin/activate
    ```

- ###### Deactivating the Python Virtual Environment:
    ```markdown
    - deactivate
    ```

- ###### Environment Variables:
    ```bash
